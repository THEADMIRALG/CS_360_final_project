# CS_360_final_project

The purpose of this application was to create a weight loss tracking app in Android studio that included personalized data connected to an account. When creating the app I really only needed two screen, the login screen and the homepage which contains all of the weightloss data. In order to complete this app I had to list the needs for the app and then I lsited the functionality I knew I can implement to fulfill those needs. I then started on the physical design of the application making sure I had every field and UI element necessary for the app to work correctly. I then started the developmental portion where I usually go in order of class importance. For this final project I started with the login portion first since I know that all the future data that would be added would tie right into the users account. I then worked on the weekly weight tracking class and the goal weight classes since they would be sub classes of the account.
